## 🚀 About Me

I am a Full-Stack Developer with strong backend and system design fundamentals, currently building scalable production-grade applications.

My experience spans:
- High-performance REST API development
- Real-time IoT telemetry systems
- MQTT-driven architectures
- Async backend pipelines
- SQL performance optimization

I focus on clean architecture, measurable impact, and systems that scale reliably.

## 🔭 I’m currently working on
Building scalable full-stack applications using React, Node.js, REST APIs, and SQL databases while optimizing backend performance, async processing, and system reliability.

## 🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on
Scalable full-stack systems, IoT backend infrastructure, MQTT-driven architectures, real-time data pipelines, and high-performance REST APIs.

## 🆘 I’m looking for help with
Advanced system design, distributed architectures, cloud-native deployments, backend scalability strategies, and production-grade DevOps workflows.

## 🌱 I’m currently learning
System Design, Microservices Architecture, Advanced SQL Optimization, Async Processing Patterns, and Cloud Deployment strategies.

## 💬 Ask me about
Full-Stack Development, REST API Design, IoT Telemetry Systems, MQTT Broker Architecture, Performance Optimization, ML Model Deployment, and Backend Scalability.

## ⚡ Fun fact
I built an MQTT Broker supporting 1,000+ concurrent IoT clients and optimized it to process 10,000 messages in 7.8 seconds using C++, FreeRTOS, and multithreading.
